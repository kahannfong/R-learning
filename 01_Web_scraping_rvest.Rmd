This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

Adapted code to practice from Julia Silge's post(https://juliasilge.com/blog/scraping-cran/)

```{r echo=FALSE}  
#load the packages first
library("tidyverse")
library("rvest")
library("stringr")
library("lubridate")

```

```{r}
basketball_links <- function(...){
  file.path("https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/",...)
}
```

Want to scrape from a bunch of pages
```{r}
url_template <- function(year1){
  paste0("http://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_",year1,"_totals.html") #template url of NBA league
  }


```

Scrape one page first
```{r}
#trying to scrape one page first
url_list <- url_template(2015)
rawhtml <- read_html(url_list)
rawtable <- html_nodes(rawhtml, "table")[[1]]
tab <- html_table(rawtable)
head(tab)
```

Now to iterate across the other pages too
```{r}

for (y in 2015:2016){
  url_list <- url_template(y)
  read_html(url_list)
  rawhtml <- read_html(url_list)
  rawtable <- html_nodes(rawhtml, "table")[[1]]
  tab <- html_table(rawtable)
  head(tab)
  if (exists("tab2")) {tab2 <- rbind(tab,tab2)}
  if (!exists("tab2")) {tab2 <- tab}
}

head(tab2)
```

This can be saved into a csv file
```{r}
write.csv(tab2, "tab2.csv", row.names = FALSE)
```


Now to get the players details from the individual player's page. This is from the body of text, so we will need to use regex as well

Test on one player page first
```{r}
pagelink <- "https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/a/acyqu01.html"  # this is the test page for one player
player_id <- str_match(pagelink,'/./(.*?).html')[,2]
rawhtml <- read_html(pagelink)  # read in html
rawdiv <- html_nodes(rawhtml,"div")  # get the portion of html that shows the tables of the players 
rawp <- html_nodes(rawdiv,"p")
## Get the information we want from the text using regex
#start with position
matched <- str_match(rawp,"Position:\n  </strong>\n  (.*?)\n")
pposition <- matched[!is.na(matched[,1]),2]
#to get player DoB
matched <- str_match(rawp,'data-birth="(.*?)">\n')
pDOB <- matched[!is.na(matched[,1]),2] %>%
  as.Date()
#Player NBA Debut
matched <- str_match(rawp,'NBA Debut: </strong><a href=(.*?)html">(.*?)</a>\n</p>')
if(length(matched[!is.na(matched[,1])])==0){
  pNBADebut <- matched[!is.na(matched[,1]),2] %>%
    as.Date()
} else {
    pNBADebut <- NA
}

#to extract player height
matched <- str_match(html_text(rawp),'\\((.*?)cm')
if(length(matched[!is.na(matched[,1])])==0){
  pheight <- NA 
} else {
    pheight <- matched[!is.na(matched[,1]),2]
  }

#to extract player weight
matched <- str_match(html_text(rawp)[3],'\\((.*?)cm,\\s(.*?)kg')
if(length(matched[!is.na(matched[,1])])==0){
  pweight <- NA
} else {
    pweight <- matched[!is.na(matched[,1]),3]
  }


#putting it all together
df <- data.frame(playerID=player_id, Position=pposition, DOB=pDOB, NBA_Deb=pNBADebut, Height=pheight, weight=pweight)
```


Collect all the player pages (by alphabet) - test on "a" first..
```{r}
pagelink <- "https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/a/"

rawhtml <- read_html(pagelink)  # read in html
rawtable <- html_nodes(rawhtml,"table")  # get the portion of html that shows the tables of the players 
tab <- html_table(rawtable)  # present as table

rawlinks <- html_nodes(rawhtml,"a") %>%  # get the "a" nodes from the html of the page
  html_attr("href")  # pull the "href" attribute from these "a" nodes
  
playerlinks <- rawlinks[str_detect(rawlinks,"/players/./")]  # filter to get list of links with only the players

#html_attr(html_nodes(rawhtml,"a"),"href")

# edit the behaviour of html_table using trace? https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42119851/how-to-get-the-link-inside-html-table-using-rvest BUT how to edit it back?
# trace(rvest:::html_table.xml_node, quote({ 
#   values      <- lapply(lapply(cells, html_node, "a"), html_attr, name = "href")
#   values[[1]] <- html_text(cells[[1]])
# }), at = 14)



```

To iterate over 2 levels, first set the functions for the 2nd level links
```{r}

alp <- c("a","b","c","d","e","f","g","h","i","j","k","l","m","n","o","p","q","r","s","t","u","v","w","y","z")  #alphabets of players

url_template1 <-function(tail){
  paste0("https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/",tail,"/")
}

url_template2 <-function(tail){
  paste0("https://www.basketball-reference.com",tail)
}
```

Next, we put it all together
```{r}
for (letters in c("a","b")){
  linklist1 <- url_template1(letters)  
  rawhtml <- read_html(linklist1)  # read in html
  rawtable <- html_nodes(rawhtml,"table")  # get the portion of html that shows the tables of the players 
  tab <- html_table(rawtable)  # present as table

  rawlinks <- html_nodes(rawhtml,"a") %>%  # get the "a" nodes from the html of the page
    html_attr("href")  # pull the "href" attribute from these "a" nodes
  
  playerlinks <- rawlinks[str_detect(rawlinks,"/players/./")]  # filter to get list of links
  playerlinks <- playerlinks[1:2]  #for testing, only want to look at 2 per alphabet
  
  if (exists("playerlinks2")) {playerlinks2 <- c(playerlinks2, playerlinks)}
  if (!exists("playerlinks2")) {playerlinks2 <- playerlinks}}
  
  for (players in playerlinks2){
    player_id <- str_match(players,'/./(.*?).html')[,2]
    rawhtml <- read_html(url_template2(players))  # read in html
    rawdiv <- html_nodes(rawhtml,"div")  # get the portion of html that shows the tables of the players 
    rawp <- html_nodes(rawdiv,"p")
    ## Get the information we want from the text using regex
    #start with position
    matched <- str_match(rawp,"Position:\n  </strong>\n  (.*?)\n")
    pposition <- matched[!is.na(matched[,1]),2]
    #to get player DoB
    matched <- str_match(as.character(rawp),'data-birth="(.*?)">\n')
    pDOB <- matched[!is.na(matched[,1]),2] %>%
      as.Date()
    #Player NBA Debut
    matched <- str_match(rawp,'NBA Debut: </strong><a href=(.*?)html">(.*?)</a>\n</p>')
    if(length(matched[!is.na(matched[,1])])!=0){
      pNBADebut <- matched[!is.na(matched[,1]),3] %>%
        as.Date(format="%B %d, %Y")
    } else {
      pNBADebut <- NA
    }
    
    #to extract player height
    matched <- str_match(html_text(rawp),'\\((.*?)cm')
    if(length(matched[!is.na(matched[,1])])==0){
      pheight <- NA 
    } else {
      pheight <- matched[!is.na(matched[,1]),2]
    }
    
    #to extract player weight
    matched <- str_match(html_text(rawp),'\\((.*?)cm,\\s(.*?)kg')
    if(length(matched[!is.na(matched[,1])])==0){
      pweight <- NA
    } else {
      pweight <- matched[!is.na(matched[,1]),3]
    }
    
    #vec <- c(player_id, pposition, pDOB, pNBADebut, pheight, pweight)
    #putting it all together
    if(exists("df2")){df2 <- rbind(df2, data.frame(player_id, pposition, pDOB, pNBADebut, pheight, pweight))} 
    if (!exists("df2")) { df2 <- data.frame(player_id, pposition, pDOB, pNBADebut, pheight, pweight)}
    
  }



```

Results:
```{r}
head(df2)
```

If we extended this code to all the players (instead of just 4 players), we'd have the dataframe to analyze! First, merge the tables - then we'll have the stats along with weight/height and other profile information... and then we can play more with the data



Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).
